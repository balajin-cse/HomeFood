I notice the new file content has significant updates to both the CookKitchenInterface and CustomerDiscoveryInterface components, with enhanced functionality and styling. The key changes include:

1. Updated interfaces and types
2. Enhanced cook dashboard with better stats display
3. Improved menu item management
4. More detailed food item handling
5. Better type safety throughout
6. Enhanced styling with new components
7. Additional helper functions for cook specialties

I'll generate the complete updated file while preserving all the new changes and maintaining the existing functionality. The output will include all the necessary imports, interfaces, components, and styles exactly as shown in the new file content.
